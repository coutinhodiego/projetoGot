  <h1>Houses Of Westeros</h1>
  <section class="houses">
    <div>
      <h2>Starks</h2>

      <p>
        Winter is Coming.<br><br> You belong to the oldest and most honorable house. Once great rulers over much of the land, you’ve fallen on hard times. Stubborn and fiercely loyal, you always do the right thing. Even if it hurts or points to extinction.
        The world has changed, and you refuse to change along with it. Hard times indeed. But remember, winter is coming, and soon the old ways will carry the day.

      <h2>Targaryens</h2>

      <p>
        Fire and Blood.<br><br> You believe might makes right. Using the great power of dragons you want to reclaim the Iron Throne. Sadly, you have long been in exile, waiting for your opportunity to strike back. You believe nothing can stop you, even
        if that belief is insane. And that’s ok, because you could be carrying the “madness” in your bloodline. If chaos is the way of the world, you will ride that chaos to a fiery victory!
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Baratheons</h2>
      <img class="houses" src="images/baratheon.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Ours is the Fury.<br><br> House Baratheon sits atop the Iron Throne. Once nothing more than a regional power, you have scrapped and fought your way to the top. But it could all be fading, now divided by infighting and a lack of leadership. Long
        used to being able to bend others to your will, you find it more difficult to rule. Stubborn to a fault, unwilling to yield, you don’t know when to quit. Your destiny has yet to be written, and now it could be time to reassert your true power.
        Nothing like a little battle to get the blood flowing.
      </p>

      <h2>Greyjoys</h2>
      <img class="houses" src="images/greyjoy.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        We Do Not Sow.<br><br> Greyjoys believe in non-traditional means to win and have to fight for everything it has. You strike from unexpected directions and win. You have strong leadership, bigger dreams, and a raider’s heart. It matters not where
        and when you fight, only that you’re still fighting. And what a fight it will be. Not respected? You don’t care. The future is bright, the wind is strong, and seas go on forever.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Lannisters</h2>
      <img class="houses" src="images/lannister.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Hear Me Roar!<br><br> You hail from the wealthiest and most powerful family in the Seven Kingdoms, and you are the real power behind the Iron Throne. Very successful, you deserve to rule. Your house uses its vast wealth to play the game of thrones.
        Correspondence, deals, and networking allow you to stay one step ahead of the competition. Battles waste money: it’s far better to win behind the scenes. But if it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight they’ll get. Crush them all and leave no survivors.
        Strong leadership and deep pockets ensure your future will be bright.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Martells</h2>
      <img class="houses" src="images/martell.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.<br><br> Even though your house is one of the Great Houses of Westeros and ruler of Dorne, you flaunt Westerosi convention. Your house is somewhat idiosyncratic in its approach to life. You are culturally very different
        from the rest of the kingdom and are willing to stretch the rules to achieve your goals. Isolated from the current events, you chart your own path to success. You see no need to get involved in the petty battles up north. Far better to relax and
        enjoy the bounty life offers you. And if any see this is a sign of weakness, let them. In the end they’ll know who the true rulers are.
